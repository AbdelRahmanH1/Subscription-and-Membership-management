## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Run

### üßæ 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AbdelRahmanH1/Subscription-and-Membership-management.git
cd Subscription-and-Membership-management
```
### üîê 2.Set up the `environment`
Create a .env file in the project root with the following keys:
```bash
DB_USERNAME = 
DB_PASSWORD =
JWT_SECRET =
```
###  üõ†Ô∏è  3.Configure `application.yaml`
The application.yaml is already set up to read from .env
```bash
spring:
  application:
    name: Subscription and Membership management

  datasource:
    url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/subscription?createDatabaseIfNotExist=true
    username: ${DB_USERNAME}
    password: ${DB_PASSWORD}

  jpa:
    show-sql: true

  web:
    resources:
      add-mappings: false

  jwt:
    secret: ${JWT_SECRET}
    token-expiration: 604800   
```
### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è  4.Run the application
Use Maven Wrapper (no need to install Maven globally):
```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
Or, if Maven is already installed:
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```
## üìò API Documentation
